## Territoria

Territoria is a map that visualizes unsafe places for women that walk in the streets of Monterrey, Mexico. The map is one 
of the tools that the team at Georregias (NGO) uses to help women move around the city with a greater sense of security.

Territoria uses gender violence reports from Monterrey's open data portal [datos.monterrey.gob.mx](https://datos.monterrey.gob.mx/) and
a street survey aimed at women that walk every day through the city.

You can take a look at the map at www.georregias.com/territoria

Territoria was built using the framework Dash (Plotly) in Python.
